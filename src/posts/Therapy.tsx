      a few people were concerned about my wellbeing, and rightfully so - a
      little out of character for me to go on rants. I generally don't think
      people will listen to what I have to say. But, after some really nice and
      heartfelt comments, I felt empowered to write about something else that
      has been on my mind lately: the stigma of going to therapy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therapy is an interesting topic. I think my parents' generation believe
      that only the "mentally ill" people go to see a psychologist, but I want
      to express that I truly think everyone could benefit from it and should be
      treating it the same as going to see their doctor (GP), dentist or car
      mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe the path to true happiness is only possible through overcoming
      pain, suffering and fear. To be the freest version of yourself you must
      work through these obstacles. You cannot go around or avoid them, you must
      face them - head on. "But, how? How do I face the insurmountable
      challenges before me?" you say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what are the opposites to what I mentioned above, the antitheses of
      pain, suffering and fear. It's love, happiness and courage. You will need
      to feel and practice these daily, to be free. Your friends, family and
      support network will help you get there but ultimately it is you and you
      alone who will have to come to realisations about yourself to get through.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe some of the actions you can take is to ask yourself the right
      questions - the exact same way a therapist would. Why do I feel this way
      about that? Why does this particular thing, person or event make me feel
      sad or happy? Angry or calm? Scared or strong? Hated or loved? 
      Pushing away? Or pushing towards... the person you want to be?

    <blockquote>
      "<strong>I</strong> must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the
      little-death that brings total obliteration. <strong>I</strong> will face
      my fear. <strong>I</strong> will permit it to pass over{' '}
      <strong>me</strong> and through <strong>me</strong>. And when it has gone
      past <strong>I</strong> will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the
      fear has gone there will be nothing. Only <strong>I</strong> will remain."
      - Frank Herbert, Dune 1965
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We all have some level of fear and suffering, and that's okay - we won't
      ever be able to fully be free of it. But therapy helps us cope and equips
      us with the ability to move forward rather than to have events or thought
      patterns hold us down. Some of our fears are justified as well. We need
      some level of them to survive, to keep our loved ones safe, and avoid
      accidents. But we cannot let them overpower us or prevent us from doing
      things we have always wanted to do, or prevent us from who we truly want to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we could all start thinking about our feelings and emotions in any
      given moment a little more rather than immediately acting or repressing
      them, the world would be a much brighter place… and we can do that! But
      it starts and ends with you, and only you. If you think therapy isn't for
      you, why not just give it a try and see what all the fuss is about? It
      will only take an hour out of your day - and, who knows, you might just
      discover something about yourself. I would also argue that if you do not
      want to go, it could be because you don't want to face those uncomfortable
      feelings or thoughts… you know the ones!
    </p>
    <p>
      The ones that say “I'm not good enough, what if they don't like me?” The
      ones that make my gut feel weird, the ones that make me wanna jump in
      front of the train, the ones that make me wanna scream, the ones that make
      me feel stupid and unloved. You are alive, in the here and now, and I'm
      sure there is at least one person, if not a therapist, that you could talk
      to about those feelings and emotions above. Try it sometime and I promise
      you, you will feel better. It's called 'venting' for a reason :)
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife said to me once "If you don't cry at therapy, did you even go to
      therapy?" and she's absolutely right, because you will be uncovering a lot
      of ground.. . uncomfortable things will come out and that is all part of
      it!<br />
      Do not see it as a weakness, you will feel stronger and a hell of a
      lot happier that you did. No pain, no gain, as they say. Why do you think
      there is always a box of tissues, right in front of you, in the room?
      (Even in Tony Soprano's session above!)

    <p>
      I hope this article empowers at least one person to book in an appointment
      with their GP to get a Mental Health Care Plan and see a therapist, like I
      did. Both this post and the Art vs AI rant have made me realize that
      thanks to going to therapy and my awesome support network, I finally have
      found my voice and hope this will help you find yours if you haven't already.

      Thanks again! <br />
